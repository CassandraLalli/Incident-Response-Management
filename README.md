# Incident-Response-Management

An incident response plan is a set of tools and procedures that your security team can use to identify, eliminate, and recover from cybersecurity threats. It is designed to help your team respond quickly and uniformly against any type of external threat.

Incident response plans ensure that responses are as effective as possible. These plans are necessary to minimize damage caused by threats, including data loss, abuse of resources, and the loss of customer trust.

Incident response planning typically includes:

The organization’s incident response strategy and how it supports business objectives
Roles and responsibilities involved in incident response
Procedures for each phase of the incident response process
Communication procedures within the incident response team, with the rest of the organization, and external stakeholders
How to learn from previous incidents to improve the organization’s security posture
